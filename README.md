# Japanese-FlipCards
Used Tkinter to make a flashcard application which shows random japanese words from a csv file and then flips to it's english translation after 5 seconds. If you have learnt the word and press correct, it removes that word from main csv file and moves it to "Leant Words" file, if not, the word might appear again!
